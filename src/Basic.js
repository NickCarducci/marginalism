          That is to say, any particular machine may yield an income which is of
          the nature of a rent, and which is sometimes called a Rent; though on
          the whole, there seems to be some advantage in calling it a
          Quasi-rent. But we cannot properly speak of the interest yielded by a
          machine. If we use the term "interest" at all, it must be in relation
          not to the machine itself, but to its money value. (Alfred Marshall,

            But when the division of labour first began to take place, this
            power of exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and
            embarrassed in its operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more
            of a certain commodity than he himself has occasion for, while
            another has less [and is the price-maker before the market is made].
            The former consequently would be glad to dispose of, and the latter
            to purchase, a part of this superfluity. But if this latter should
            chance to have nothing that the former stands in need of, no
            exchange can be made between them. (Adam Smith,{space}

          Monetary theory has no ideological content. It deals with a scientific
          question—how a particular social contrivance works. It may surprise
          most readers to learn that, in today’s terminology, Karl Marx could be
          labeled a “monetarist”—a term that is currently, if incorrectly,
          regarded as almost synonymous with “conservative” or “pro free
          market.” (Milton Friedman, Marx and Money, 27 October 1980. p. The
          Newsweek/Daily Beast Company, p. 95; Hoover Inst.)

          <h2>The Will to Gen</h2>
          Paul starts from the need for a mystery felt by the broad, religiously
          excited masses: he seeks a sacrifice, a bloody phantas­ magoria which
          will stand up in competition with the images of the mystery cults: God
          on the cross, blood-drinking, the urtio mystica with the “sacrifice.”
          He seeks to bring the afterlife (the blissful, atoned afterlife of the
          individual soul) as resurrection into a causal relationship with that
          sacrifice (after the type of Dionysus, Mithras, Osiris). He needs to
          bring the concept guilt and atonement into the foreground, not a new
          way of life (as Jesus himself had demon­ strated and lived) but a new
          cult, a new faith, a faith in a miraculous transformation (
          “redemption” through faith). He understood what the pagan world had
          the greatest need of, and from the facts of Christ’s life and death
          made a quite arbitrary selection, giving everything a new
          accentuation, shifting the emphasis everywhere—he annulled primitive
          Christianity as a matter or principle— The attempt to destroy priests
          and theologians culminated, thanks to Paul, in a new priesthood and
          theology—in a new ruling order and a church. The attempt to destroy
          the exaggerated inflation of the “person” culminated in faith in the
          “eternal person” (in concern for “eternal salvation”—), in the most
          paradoxical excess of personal egoism* This is the humor of the
          situation, a tragic humor: Paul re­ erected on a grand scale precisely
          that which Christ had annulled through his way of living. At last,
          when the church was complete, it sanctioned even the existence of the
          state.

          barbarians and Germans! How thoroughly all that I first had to be
          barbarized, Germanized! To those who had dreamed a Valhalla: who found
          happiness only in war!—A su­ pranational religion preached in a chaos
          where no nations even existed yet—The only way to refute priests and
          religions is this: to show that their errors have ceased to be
          beneficial—that they rather do harm; in short, that their own “proof

          that Christianity has sanctified with the name “love,” Moreover, it is
          the cultured and even the overspirited orders that find satisfaction

            perform even good actions only for the time being, merely as a

          <h1>"Faith" or "works"?</h1>— But that "works,” the habit of certain
          works, should engender a certain evaluation and finally a certain
          disposition is as natural as it is unnatural that mere evaluation
          should produce “works.” One must practice deeds, not the strength­
          ening of one’s value-feelings; one must first have some ability— The
          Christian dilettantism of Luther. Faith is a pons asinorum.u The
          background is a profound conviction on the part of Luther and his kind
          of their incapacity for Christian works, a personal fact disguised
          beneath an extreme doubt as to whether activity of all kinds is not
          sin and the work of the Devil: so that the value of existence resides
          in single highly tensed conditions of inactivity (prayer, effusion,
          etc.),— In the last resort he was right: the in­ stincts expressed in
          all the actions of the Reformers are the most brutal that exist. Only
          by an absolute turning away from them­ selves, by absorption in their
          opposite, only as an illusion (“faith”) was existence endurable to
          them.

            Science—this has been hitherto a way of putting an end to the
            complete confusion in which things exist, by hypotheses that
            “explain” everything—so it has come from the intellect’s dislike of
            chaos.— This same dislike seizes me when I consider myself: I should
            like to form an image of the inner world, too, by means of some
            schema, and thus triumph over intellectual confusion. Morality has
            been a simplification of this kind: it taught that men were known,
            familiar.— Now we have destroyed morality—we have again become
            completely obscure to ourselves! I know that I know nothing of
            myself. Physics proves to be a boon for the heart: science (as the
            way to knowledge) acquires a new charm after morality has been
            eliminated—and because it is here alone that we find consistency, we
            have to construct our life so as to preserve it. This yields a sort
            of practical reflection on the con­ ditions of our existence as men
            of knowledge.

          Nietzsche was interested in the value of life not the non-immoral
          morale impediments. He (Nietzsche, as a nothing) considered anarchists
          as destructive to value.

          efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount
          necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use increases its
          demand, negating reductions in resource use.
